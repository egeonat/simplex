# You can fill this file with the objective function values and the constraint equations.
# The lines with "#" or whitespace at the start are ignored by the program.
# The rest of the format is very strict. You must follow it or the program will crash.

# Objective function coefficients (C)
4 1
# Constraints (A and b)
3 1 = 3
4 3 >= 6
1 2 <= 4
