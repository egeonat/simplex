# You can fill this file with the objective function values and the constraint equations.
# The lines with "#" or whitespace at the start are ignored by the program.
# The rest of the format is very strict. You must follow it or the program will crash.

# Objective function coefficients (C)
2 3
# Constraints (A and b)
